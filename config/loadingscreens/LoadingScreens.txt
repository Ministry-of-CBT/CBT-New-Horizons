tips.addTip("oliwier509 > Tip 45: Ever since I was a young boy I've been interested in blondes, but I've mostly been repelled because they are stupid white women who do not know how to think. One day, while I was playing touhou, I saw an image of a peculiar blonde with a witch attire. I immediately fell in love. The long, luscious hair, the dominating yet cute attire, the smug, tsundere, yet cute personality all formed into one perfect being by the name of Marisa Kirisame. And so I began my search for Marisa, I played all the touhou games with all the spell cards just so I could the most out of her majesty. I searched all of booru for images of her, just so I could get to see her beautiful tomboyish body. You see, Cirno is not the tomboyish girl in love. Marisa is. She is in love with me. Yet the reality barrier separates us like Romeo and Juliette. It is the cruel fate that is reality that separates such star-crossed lovers from each other. Only something so powerful as the reality barrier can separate me from my dear Marisa. For it is my true fate to be married to my lover. On dark days where there is no sun, I shall caress Marisa and tell her everything is alright. On bright days, where there is nought but bliss, I will stay by her side, to share the bliss infinitefold, like two mirrors in proximity. On the adventurous days, we will steal what we wish. Some days, we will steal diamonds. Some days, we will steal virginities. And always, we will steal our hearts. Each other's hearts. For it is the true love that does not brag, it only contains itself infinitely. Such is the love of me and Marisa Kirisame.")
tips.addTip(":Marisad: > Tip 46: Out of all of Gensokyo, it's almost undoubtedly true that Kirisame Marisa would give the best blowjobs. Sure, some of the other girls might be easier. Once you had her convinced to do it, though, Marisa would be by far the most competent at it. Let's start with experience. We know that Marisa has a good looking body, because she's slim, fashion-aware, and a practical talker. Marisa is also pretty neurotypical for Gensokyo, with references to going out permanently borrowing from everyone as a regular activity. All of this points to a girl that would have gone down at least a few times in her life, but you have to remember that she literally worked on youkai extermination while pursuing her dream of being a magician. That's the sign of a hard-working and outgoing girl that's at least been casually intimate as a matter of course. When it comes to sucking dick, she'd know what she's doing. Then there's enthusiasm. Marisa is a perfectionist at using her throat. She's a tryhard at talking, she does her reps with her rizz daze and even when it comes to casual activities like youkai extermination, she always gives it her all. There's no reason to think she'd give any less when it comes to pleasing her partner. She would be shameless about slurping on cock and even continue when it got uncomfortable for her, all to ensure that she does a good job. And finally, there's raw, natural talent. Marisa has amazing lung capacity and an agile tongue. Anyone that's heard her talking or even heard her cute little noises knows that she's an expert at making you happy with her mouth. In short, if you want the absolute best blowjob that you can find from Gensokyo, pick Marisa. There is no girls that will drain your balls half as well as Marisa. And that's one reason why Marisa is my beloved.")

tips.addTip("Cerbs > Tip 49: Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3”03’ tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they’re large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there’s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it’d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more ")
